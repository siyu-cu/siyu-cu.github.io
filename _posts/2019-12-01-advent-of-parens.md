A few days ago [@plexus](https://twitter.com/plexus) (civilian name: Arne Brasseur) shared a pretty cool idea on twitter: Write a blog post every day from the 1st of December to the 24th of December on somethings to do with Clojure. And so the ["Advent of Parens"](https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-11-25-advent-of-parens) was born!

The Clojure community is filled with elegant code and really smart people. There are, however, very few beginner-friendly tutorials and the documentation is sparse. At times it can be quite intimidating and discouraging. It was so for me. [Living Clojure](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do?sortby=publicationDate) by [@gigasquid](https://twitter.com/gigasquid) was the turning point. It was a very accessible introduction to Clojure.

I think accessible writing is critical for the Clojure community to flourish. That's why I'm super excited about the "Advent of Parens". I'm not sure I'll manage all 24 days but I'll try my absolute bestest. Catch you tomorrow. 

_May your build always pass._
